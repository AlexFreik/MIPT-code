# Projects
Some of my projects that I wrote at the University.

## Bigineger & Rational
This is a C++ class for very large (with ~sting_size_t digits) integers and rational numbers of numbers.

## [Minimal.io](https://github.com/Unicorn-Dev/Minimal.io)
This is a simple desktop game written in Python3.
